RWAddonAutomations
==================

*Automator action to create rwaddons files*

This script can be used to create rwaddons files for RW6. Drag one or more Stack files onto it and it creates a corresponding addon installation file.

- If you drag "foo.stack" onto it, it will create a foo.rwaddons file
- If you drag "foo.stack" and "bar.stack" onto it, it will create "archive.rwaddons" including both Stack files for installation
